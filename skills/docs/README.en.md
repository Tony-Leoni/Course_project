**21 open-source Claude Skills replacing a marketing department for small business.** Direct response methodology by Ogilvy / Schwartz / Hopkins baked into every agent. MIT licensed. Runs on Claude Code with Anthropic API ($5–30/month).

🇷🇺 [Russian README](../README.md)

## Why this exists

A full-time marketer in Russia costs 100–200K RUB/month (~$1,100–$2,200). Marketing agencies start at 150K RUB. Most small businesses can't afford either — but still need positioning, copywriting, landing pages, email sequences, ads, SEO, competitor research.

This repo packages 21 narrow AI agents (one task each) that do that work. Real cases: a dental clinic in Moscow grew from 12 to 47 weekly leads in 6 weeks. A Greek café cut content production from 20 hours/week to 4.

## What's inside

## Methodology

Three principles, each baked into every agent:

### Ogilvy — *headlines = 80%*
Every product claim must be **verifiable**. Adjectives like "high-quality", "best", "professional" — banned. Replace with a number, comparison, or quote.

### Schwartz — *5 awareness levels*
Before any output, the agent mentally identifies the audience level:
1. **Unaware** — don't know they have a problem
2. **Problem Aware** — know the pain, don't know solutions
3. **Solution Aware** — know solutions exist
4. **Product Aware** — know about you, haven't bought
5. **Most Aware** — ready to buy

Email at the wrong level = unsubscribe. Landing at the wrong level = empty cart.

### Hopkins — *Scientific Advertising*
Advertising = a salesperson in print. A salesperson doesn't say "we're a team of professionals", they say "847 clients, 92% returned".
